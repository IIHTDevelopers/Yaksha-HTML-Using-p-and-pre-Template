    <h1>Using Paragraph and Preformatted Tags</h1>

    <p>This is a normal paragraph. The text inside the p tag is displayed as regular text with automatic line breaks.</p>

    <p>Here is another paragraph with a space between it and the previous one. The p tag always adds space between paragraphs by default.</p>

    <pre>
    function helloWorld() {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
    </pre>
